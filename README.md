Ever wanted to ask me something? Go ahead and post your question now! About my life, work, hobbies etc etc...

Also, this is a good place to make a tutorial request or leave feedback about my articles and videos. I'm really happy when my students and readers get in touch!

### Some Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked via e-mail.
- If you want to book a lecture, it is better to do so on [this page](http://bodrovis.tech/en/teaching).
- I speak Russian and understand (more or less) Ukrainian and Polish. Still, it is better to write in English.
- Please, be civil and polite.
